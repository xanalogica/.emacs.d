* Introduction to Babel for Org-mode or What Is This File?

Babel is Org-mode's ability to execute or extract source code within Org-mode
documents.  The source can be different programming languages, all in the same
=.org= file.

Babel has special support for embedded your Emacs initialization code into
Org-mode files, so that you can make use of the nice features of Org-mode such
as outline folding, tags, notes, HTML export, etc.  The /org-babel-load-file/
function can be used to load the Emacs Lisp code blocks embedded in a literate
Org-mode file in the same way that you might load a regular Emacs Lisp file.

To use org-mode for organizing your Emacs configuration, a very minimum amount
of configuration goes into the user's =~/.emacs.d/init.el= file.

** Install the 'use-package' module to more efficiently organize package settings

There are many ways to provide package settings, from raw Elisp to tidy macros.
The github:[[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] Elisp macro allows one to isolate package configuration
in your Emacs configuration files in a way that is both performance-oriented
and tidy.

- [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/spotlight-use-package-a-declarative-configuration-tool][Spotlight: use-package, a declarative configuration tool - Mastering Emacs]]
- [[http://cachestocaches.com/2015/8/getting-started-use-package/][Getting Started with Use-Package]]

;; Make sure I have 'use-package' installed in my Emacs
;;;  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
;;;    (package-refresh-contents)       ;; refresh catalog of remote registry
;;;    (package-install 'use-package))  ;;   and install 'use-package' module

;;;  (eval-when-compile
;;;    (require 'use-package))

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path
      "~/.emacs.d/lisp/use-package")
  (require 'use-package)
  (setq use-package-verbose t)  ;; to assist debugging configuration
#+END_SRC

** Optionally, use ~diminish~ package to hide selected minor-modes from my modeline

Loading github:[[https://github.com/myrjola/diminish.el][diminish]] Elisp package causes ~use-package~ to enable a
configuration keyword =:diminish <SYMBOL>= in your ~use-package~ invocation.
This keyword empowers you to remove or change minor mode strings in your
mode-line.  Such diminished modes are minor modes with no modeline display,
because we don't want to be reminded of it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;;  (use-package diminish
;;;    :ensure nil  ;; this package is NOT essential for my configuration to work
;;;  )
#+END_SRC

** Use the ~bind-key~ Elisp package to enhance ~use-package~ with keywords

Loading the ~bind-key~ Elisp package causes ~use-package~ to enable additional
configuration keywords:

- :bind
- :bind*
- :bind-keymap
- :bind-keymap*

The ~bind-key~ Elisp package is *part of* of the ~use-package~ code
distribution.  In particular, the logic of the new ~use-package~ configuration
symbols is in
[[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/blob/master/use-package-bind-key.el]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;;  (use-package bind-key
;;;    :ensure t  ;; this package is essential for my configuration to work
;;;  )
#+END_SRC

** Optionally, use ~general~ Elisp package for easier key definitions

The github:[[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el~general]] Elisp package is
primarily for making key definition more clear and concise.  It adds the
=:general= keyword to the ~use-package~ macro.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package general
    :load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/general/" ;; use my Git checkout
  )
#+END_SRC

** Hotkey for Quickly Reloading This Configuration After Changes
The first thing I want is the ability to quickly reload my Emacs configuration
each time I make a change in this file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun reload() (interactive)
    "Reload ~/.emacs"

    (if (file-exists-p "~/.emacs.d/init.el")
        (load-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el"))
  )
  (global-set-key [f6] 'reload)
#+END_SRC

** Additional Small Configuration File
*** Place for Small Automatic Configuration Settings

Emacs likes to write small tidbits of manual configuration into an .el file so
I use a small file that I never look into, to keep it separate from my
=config.org=.  It also contains my private information like passwords.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/custom-settings.el")
  (load custom-file t)
#+END_SRC

** Package Management

To manage my Emacs packages I rely upon the Cask library along with Pallet, a
helper package that updates my Cask file (list of packages) as I add and
remove them using the =M-x list-packages= Emacs UI.

*** Cask

Modern Emacs v25 (for me) uses the built-in package.el but then I apply the
Cask add-on module to /Caskify/ my =~/.emacs.d/= dirctory and use stable
package repositories.  Cask helps to manage dependencies for my local Emacs
configuration.

I have Cask installed from a Git checkout under =~/.cask/= with the binary
command /cask/ in my shell path under =~/.cask/bin/=.

You can read about Cask at:

   http://cask.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

with the source Git repo at:

   https://github.com/cask/cask

*** Pallet

[[https://github.com/rdallasgray/pallet][Pallet]] is a package management helper for Emacs.  It's main job is to add and
delete package references from your =~/.emacs.d/Cask= file as you install and
delete them using the built-in Emacs package management system.

Pallet has a very simple interface:

- M-x pallet-init creates a Cask file using information about installed
      packages from the existing package.el system
- M-x pallet-install installs packages listed in your Cask file
- M-x pallet-update updates installed packages

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package pallet
    :ensure t
    :config
      (pallet-mode t)
  )
#+END_SRC

This will bootstrap cask and pallet.  It will create a =~/.emacs.d/.cask/=
directory containing all the packages you will install.

Restart your emacs, and from now on pallet-mode will be active: any time you
install a package with M-x package-list-packages and similar, pallet will
write it's name down in your =~/.emacs.d/Cask= file and the files it downloads
will go under the =~/.emacs.d/.cask/= directory.


** Protecting My Work (backups, undo, encryption, versioning)
*** Backups

I keep my backups under =~/.emacs.d/backups/=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default make-backup-files
    t)                                  ;; Whether to make backup files at all or not.

  (add-to-list 'backup-directory-alist
    (cons "." "~/.emacs.d/backups/"))   ;; Specify where to store backups of all files.
#+END_SRC

*** Undo

The ~undo-tree~ emacs package is great for visualizing the undo tree.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-undo-tree-mode 1)  ;;turn on everywhere

;;;  (global-set-key (kbd "C-z") 'undo)

;;;  (defalias 'redo 'undo-tree-redo)
;;;  (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-z") 'redo)

  ;;; C-x u to run undo-tree-visualize

#+END_SRC

*** Content Encryption

There is encryption of entire files and there is encryption of sections of
Org-mode outlines.

**** Encrypting Entire Files within Emacs

Emacs comes with the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/epa.html][EasyPG]] Assistant, the all-in-one GnuPG interface for
Emacs.  EasyPG also contains the library interface called _EasyPG Library_.

EasyPG Assistant provides the following features.

- Key management
- Cryptographic operations on regions
- Cryptographic operations on files
- Dired integration
- Mail-mode integration
- Automatic encryption/decryption of *.gpg files

By default, every file whose extension is ‘.gpg’ will be treated as encrypted.
That is, when you attempt to open such a file which already exists, the
decrypted text is inserted in the buffer rather than encrypted one.  On the
other hand, when you attempt to save the buffer to a file whose extension is
‘.gpg’, encrypted data is written.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;;  (require 'epa-file)
  (use-package epa-file)

  (defadvice epg--start (around advice-epg-disable-agent activate)
    "Make epg--start not able to find a gpg-agent"
    (let ((agent (getenv "GPG_AGENT_INFO")))
      (setenv "GPG_AGENT_INFO" nil)
      ad-do-it
      (setenv "GPG_AGENT_INFO" agent)))

  (defun epg-disable-agent ()
    "Make EasyPG bypass any gpg-agent"
    (interactive)
    (ad-enable-advice 'epg--start 'around 'advice-epg-disable-agent)
    (ad-activate 'epg--start)
    (message "EasyPG gpg-agent bypassed"))

  (defun epg-enable-agent ()
    "Make EasyPG use a gpg-agent after having been disabled with
    epg-disable-agent"
    (interactive)
    (ad-disable-advice 'epg--start 'around 'advice-epg-disable-agent)
    (ad-activate 'epg--start)
    (message "EasyPG gpg-agent re-enabled"))
#+END_SRC

To set up Emacs for transparent encryption and decryption our need the add the
following to your .emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;NOT NEEDED?  (epa-file-enable)

  ;; If non-nil, always asks user to select recipients.
  ;;  (setq epa-file-select-keys
  ;;      nil)

  ;; *Recipient(s) used for encrypting files.
  ;;  (setq epa-file-encrypt-to
  ;;      ("jeff@taupro.com"))

  ;;  )
#+END_SRC

If you want to temporarily disable this behavior, use =M-x epa-file-disable=,
and then to enable this behavior use =M-x epa-file-enable=.

At file-save time you are prompted to select recipients but this prompt can be
suppressed by putting the following line on the first line of the text being
encrypted.

#+BEGIN_SRC example
  ;; -*- epa-file-encrypt-to: ("ueno@unixuser.org") -*-
#+END_SRC

Some useful functions are:

- M-x epa-list-keys		:: browse your pub keyring, e.g. 'gpg --list-keys'
- M-x epa-list-secret-keys	:: browse your pvt keyring, e.g. 'gpg --list-secret-keys'
- M-x epa-sign-region		:: create a cleartext signature of the region
- M-x epa-encrypt-file		:: encrypt a file

In the '*Keys*' buffer, several commands are available:

- m		:: select (mark) keys
- o		:: output marked key(s) to prompted filename

**** Encrypting Specific Entries in an org-mode Outline Hierarchy with org-crypt.

Tagging Subtrees for Encryption

If you just want to encrypt the text of an entry, but not the headline, or
properties you can use org-crypt.  In order to use org-crypt you need to add
something like the following to your .emacs:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;  (require 'org-crypt)
  (use-package org-crypt)

  (org-crypt-use-before-save-magic)

  ;; Prevent having encrypted text inside encrypted text, by turning off tag inheritance.
  (setq org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance (quote ("crypt")))

  ;; GPG key to use for encryption
  ;; Either the Key ID or set to nil to use symmetric encryption.
  (setq org-crypt-key "jrush@taupro.com")
#+END_SRC

Now any text below a headline that has a :crypt: tag will be automatically be
encrypted when the file is saved.  If you want to use a different tag just
customize the =org-crypt-tag-matcher= variable.

To decrypt the text just call =M-x org-decrypt-entry= and the encrypted text
where the point is will be replaced with the plain text.  If you use this
feature a lot, you will probably want to bind =M-x org-decrypt-entry= to a
key.

Entries with a =:crypt:= tag will be automatically be encrypted when you save
the file.

If you have autosave turned on and decrypt the files encrypted entries, the
autosave file will contain the entries in plain text.  For this reason your
should disable autosave for encrypted files.

Note that if you encrypt the whole file, its content won't appear in the
agenda view.  But, encrypting a header section won't exclude itself from
agenda view as long as you put time settings on the header not in its content
because its content is encrypted.

**** Disabling Backups of Files Containing Encrypted Content
Article: [[http://anirudhsasikumar.net/blog/2005.01.21.html][Controlling Backups]] of Sensitive Files

With org-crypt, if you have autosave turned on and decrypt the entries within
Emacs, the autosave file will contain the entries in plain text.  For this
reason let's define a minor-mode we can place onto files containing encrypted
content.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-minor-mode sensitive-mode
    "For sensitive files like password lists.
     It disables backup creation and auto saving.

     With no argument, this command toggles the mode.
     Non-null prefix argument turns on the mode.
     Null prefix argument turns off the mode."

    ;; The initial value.
    nil

    ;; The indicator for the mode line.
    " Sensitive"

    ;; The minor mode bindings.
    nil

    (if (symbol-value sensitive-mode)
        (progn

            ;; disable backups
            (set (make-local-variable 'backup-inhibited) t)

            ;; disable auto-save
            (if auto-save-default
                (auto-save-mode -1)))

            ;resort to default value of backup-inhibited
            (kill-local-variable 'backup-inhibited)

            ;resort to default auto save setting
            (if auto-save-default
                (auto-save-mode 1))))
#+END_SRC

Set sensitive mode to turn on by default for files having the =.gpg=
extension.  The following code does exactly that:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq auto-mode-alist
      (append '(("\\.gpg$" . sensitive-mode))
               auto-mode-alist))
#+END_SRC

*** Sync Errors Between In-Memory and On-Disk Buffers

Sometimes a buffer I have in memory gets out of sync with its copy on disk,
say when I update the file using Git or some other tool.  In this case, *IF*
I've not made any changes to the in-memory copy, I do not want to overwrite
the on-disk copy but rather treat the on-disk copy as newer and replace my
in-memory copy from that.  This protects me from accidental overwrites.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq global-auto-revert-mode t)
#+END_SRC

         backup-by-copying-when-linked t) ;; Copy linked files, don't rename.

   (defun force-backup-of-buffer ()
     (let ((buffer-backed-up nil))
       (backup-buffer)))

*** Exporting an Org-mode File to Other Formats
**** to LaTeX (.pdf)

#+BEGIN_SRC DISABLEemacs-lisp :no-expand
  ;;;NP (require 'org-latex)
#+END_SRC

Currently, in order for a user to use minted for colored latex export of
src code, s/he would

1. install pygments

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $ emerge dev-python/pygments
   #+END_EXAMPLE

2. indicate which listings converter to use

   (setq org-export-latex-listings 'minted)
   (add-to-list 'org-export-latex-packages-alist '("" "minted"))

   #+BEGIN_SRC DISABLEDemacs-lisp
     ;; (setq org-export-latex-listings t)
   #+END_SRC

  (add-to-list 'org-export-latex-packages-alist '("" "listings"))
  (add-to-list 'org-export-latex-packages-alist '("" "color"))

3. Add the minted package to `org-export-latex-packages-alist':

   (add-to-list 'org-export-latex-packages-alist '("" "minted"))

4. Configure `org-latex-to-pdf-process' so that the -shell-escape option
   is passed to pdflatex.

5. Install some nice fonts (under Gentoo Linux).

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     emerge media-fonts/dejavu
     emerge media-fonts/sil-gentium
     emerge media-fonts/sil-charis
     emerge media-fonts/libertine-ttf
   #+END_SRC

6. Install a latex->pdf converter better than _pdflatex_:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     emerge  dev-texlive/texlive-xetex
   #+END_SRC

   and configure Emacs to use it:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;;;np (setq org-latex-to-pdf-process
     ;;;np   '("xelatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode %f"
     ;;;np     "xelatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode %f")) ;; for multiple passes
   #+END_SRC

7. Define a LaTex template to use

   'org-article' for export org documents to the LaTex 'article', using
    XeTeX and some fancy fonts; requires XeTeX (see org-latex-to-pdf-process)

Arbitrary semantic markup in Org-mode files is implemented by defining a new
link type in .emacs. The following code block defines a new link type, latex,
whose path argument can hold the name of any LaTeX command. A link such as
[latex:proglang][Org-mode] will export \proglang{Org-mode} to the LaTeX
file. In this way, it is possible to make the Org-mode LaTeX exporter conform
to the semantic markup defined in arbitrary style files. Org-mode will even
complete your new link type!

To make a hyperlink reference \[\[some place\]\] in text work in LaTeX, the following is necessary.

#+BEGIN_SRC DISABLEDemacs-lisp
  (setq org-export-latex-hyperref-format "\\ref{%s}")
#+END_SRC

It is often the case that paths are long and difficult to break at the end of
a line. One way to get line breaks right is to wrap a path in the path command
from the url package. This can be done with a link such as this one
(abbreviated for obvious reasons) [latex:path][/path/ ...], which gets typeset
so it will break at the end of the line,
/path/to/a/file/nested/very/deeply/in/the/directory/structure.

"abbreviations, templates, and other ways to expand or transform text"

Emacs has a separate manual for [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/autotype.html][autotyping]], which I had never read before. The
short manual covers:

- abbrev
- skeleton
- auto-insert
- copyright messages
- timestamps
- temp

*** Templates
**** About the YASnippet Package

[[http://capitaomorte.github.com/yasnippet/][YASnippet]] is a template system for Emacs, an Emacs package for easily
inserting textual templates for any emacs-mode (programming language).  It
allows you to type an abbreviation, followed by a trigger key and have it
automatically expand into a block of text.  It comes bundled with templates
for languages like C, C++, Python, SQL, LaTeX, HTML, CSS and more.  You do not
need to know Emacs ELisp to create your own.

YASnippet supports templates with parameters and the ability to place the
cursor within the inserted text for quick filling in of the template.  If all
you want is inserting static text, without parameters or moving cursor, then
use Emacs package "abbrev".

**** Activating YASnippet

YASnippet can be activated globally or for specific Emacs modes.  I choose to
activate it for individual modes.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;;  (require 'yasnippet)
  (use-package yasnippet)
;;; (require 'yasnippet-snippets)   ;; a rich collection of pre-written snippets
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (yas-global-mode 0)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;; (yas-recompile-all)
  (yas-reload-all)   ;; rescan snippet definitions into memory
  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'yas-minor-mode)
  (add-hook 'python-mode-hook #'yas-minor-mode)
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'yas-minor-mode)
#+END_SRC

**** My Catalog of Template Definitions

Some of the useful snippets I have created are:

***** for Org-Mode (in directory [[~/.emacs.d/snippets/org-mode/]])
- block    :: block
- el       :: elisp block
- email    :: #+email
- title    :: #+title
- sourceblock :: source block
- options  :: #+OPTIONS ${0}
- figure   :: captioned figure

***** for Python-Mode (in directory [[~/.emacs.d/snippets/python-mode/]])

****** Group: statements
******* def<TAB>		Function Definition, with prompted fields
******* defm<TAB>		Method Definition, with prompted fields

******* class<TAB>	Class Definition, with prompted fields

******* for<TAB>		For-Loop, with prompted fields
******* ifmain<TAB>	If-Main Conditional
******* while<TAB>	While-Loop

******* pysetup<TAB>	setup.py Skeleton
******* idir		Iterate over a Single Directory
******* args		Args Parsing
******* itree		Iterate over a Directory Tree
******* prop		Property Descriptor
******* iplace		Modifying Files In-Place

****** Licenses

******* buildout		Buildout Skeleton

****** ZCML
******* ZCML<TAB>		expands into an empty ZCML configuration file

**** Where I Store My Template Definitions

There are snippets stored in a system directory that comes with the package,
and there are snippets stored under my home directory in a naming hierarchy
based on Emacs modenames.

- ~/.emacs.d/snippets/
- ~/.emacs.d/.cask/25.3/elpa/stan-snippets-9.2.0/snippets/

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;;  (setq yas/root-directory "~/.emacs.d/snippets")
;;;  (yas/load-directory yas/root-directory)
#+END_SRC

To have the menu show only the tables for the currently active mode, set
=yas/use-menu= to =abbreviate=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;;  '(yas/use-menu (quote abbreviate))
#+END_SRC

**** Developing New Template Definitions

At the Emacs prompt, invoke "yas/new-snippet" to reload a snippet you are
developing.  If you specify a name that is not yet defined, it will prompt
you and guide you through creating it.

Snippets hang off of various Emacs modes, like python-mode or html-mode.

Snippets are inserted when the "trigger key" (TAB) is pressed after a textual
key.

Two commands are defined in this mode:

    - =M-x yas/load-snippet-buffer=

        When editing a snippet, this loads the snippet into the correct mode
        and menu. Bound to *C-c C-c* by default while in snippet-mode.

    - =M-x yas/tryout-snippet=

        When editing a snippet, this opens a new empty buffer, sets it to the
        appropriate major mode and inserts the snippet there, so you can see
        what it looks like. This is bound to *C-c C-t* while in snippet-mode.

[[http://capitaomorte.github.com/yasnippet/snippet-development.html][Snippet Development]]

- =M-x yas/new-snipper=           (to create a new one)

*** Auto-Completion
**** Emacs Completion Engines:
- manual:[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ido.html][IDO]]

 - iswitchb
 - The package [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings][InteractivelyDoThings]] (IDO) is part of Emacs, starting with release 22.
   - ido + ido-ubiquitous + ido-vertical-mode
   - matches anywhere, narrows down set, has fuzzy matching
 - Helm
   helm-descbinds
   helm-show-kill-ring
   helm-completing-read-handlers-alist
 - Ivy    ivy + counsel
 - projectile

**** Places to Use Completion Engines:
- open files   C-x C-f :: find-file -> ido-find-file
   - can use bookmarks instead
   - can open many files at once using wildcards
   - open a directory using dired and then open files in it with C-o

- switch buffers  C-x b :: switch-to-buffer -> ido-switch-buffer

- navigate directories
- C-h f
- C-h v
- M-x NAME
- org-capture
- org-file    browse all attachments

***** Org-Mode Themes

A popular way of customizing Emacs colors is the use the #color-theme#
package, of which a number of those these are aware of Org-mode.

For my Gentoo Linux distribution I run, I had to emerge (install):

   $ emerge app-emacs/color-theme

There is also a newer approach called *custom themes* but custom themes do not
replace color themes, as each approach has its advantages.

****** Activate it inside a Python buffer:

 All you need to do is to call jedi:setup in python buffer. To do that, add
 the following in your Emacs configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;;  (setq jedi:setup-keys t)
;;;  (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'jedi:setup)

;;;  (setq jedi:key-show-doc (kbd "C-c D")) ;; avoid collision with ropemac

If auto-completion is all you need, use jedi:ac-setup instead:

  (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'jedi:ac-setup)

To setup recommended keybinds for Jedi.el, add this to your Emacs
configuration. Note that you must set jedi:setup-keys before loading
jedi.el. See its docstring (<f1> v jedi:setup-keys) for more information.:

- <C-tab>		:: jedi:key-complete
    Complete code at point. (`jedi:complete')

- C-.		:: jedi:key-goto-definition
    Goto the definition of the object at point. (`jedi:goto-definition')

- C-c d		:: jedi:key-show-doc
    Goto the definition of the object at point. (`jedi:show-doc')

- C-c r		:: jedi:key-related-names
    Find related names of the object at point.
    (`helm-jedi-related-names' / `anything-jedi-related-names')

**** ipython support
Sometimes it is useful to find completion using Python interpreter.  To do
that in a seamless manner, you can use IPython and its Emacs binding EIN
(Emacs IPython Notebook).  See =ein:jedi-setup= in the EIN manual.  Using this
setup, you can run auto-completion command in =Jedi.el= and EIN simultaneously.

**** Gnu [[http://flymake.sourceforge.net/][Flymake]] -- an on-the-fly syntax checker for GNU Emacs

Flymake performs on-the-fly syntax checks, of source files being edited, using
an external syntax check tool of your choosing.  It highlights erroneous lines
and displays associated error messages.  Flymake ships with Emacs.

Flymake is implemented as an Emacs minor mode.  It runs your syntax check tool
in the background, passing it a temporary copy of the current buffer and
parses the output for known error/warning message patterns.  Flymake then
highlights erroneous lines (that is, lines for which at least one error or
warning has been reported), and displays an overall buffer status in the mode
line.

A syntax check is started whenever:

  a) a buffer is loaded,
  b) a newline character is added to the buffer, and
  c) some changes were made to the buffer more than t seconds ago (t is configurable).

The set of errors/warnings to complain about is specified in my
=~/bin/flaker.py= script that invokes the pyflakes tool.

First, I replace the built-in function to Flymake that creates temporary
files.  I do this because Flymake gives me a file creation error if the
directory containing the source file is read-only.

Next, I provide a Python script, to invoke from Emacs, that runs the
=pyflakes= with the options I wish, and that parses the output from
=pyflakes= into what Flymake needs to highlight errors and warnings in my
source file.

***** Presentation

Flymake uses two Emacs faces to highlight error and warning lines.

1) =flymake-errline=  (inherits from face =error=, color red)
2) =flymake-warnline= (inherits from face =warning=, color yellow)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC

The default flymake behavior is to display the error/warning message(s) on
mouse hover over the broken sourceline.  However for keyboard jockeys who
avoid mousing, the [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlyMake#toc11][FlymakeCursor]] package changes that to dispay the
error/warning message(s) for the current line in the minibuffer.

- my own training

- I initially started with passive tag words like TOSTUDY or THINGSTOSTUDY but
  since have switched to imperative tag words, like STUDY, COMPOSE, TRAVEL to
  encourage my mind to actually do them.

- STUDY ::

  This tag is for topics, websites, books etc. that I want to find time to
  study more closely.  Sometimes it is found with the :LINK: tag if it is
  website URL, or :VIDEO: or :BOOK: but I haven't found searching by those
  that important.

  I don't collect my :STUDY: items in one file or place, but rather believe
  that they should be scattered among my notes under various topics.  For
  example, I have :STUDY: headlines under Finance, under Philosophy and under
  Technology.  I do sometimes apply a priority tag to them but generally don't
  further subdivide or organize them.  I do SCHEDULE them if I want to nudge
  myself to get around to doing so.

  On my Android, I have the Orgzly app installed and always watching my Dropbox
  collection of .org files.  And I have defined a named search in Orgzly titled
  "Things to Study" so I can at any time pull up and study something when I
  have spare time.  The query string is:

  #+NAME: Orgzly: Things to Study
  #+BEGIN_SRC text

**** Predefined Information Capture Templates

Capturing is primarily about defining:

  1) places to quickly write things
  2) templates to help structure what you write

In my approach, capture should be used for ??? and not for things that are
better handled with tags where they can be distributed throughout .org files.
Sometimes information should be in one place and other times it belongs
scattered throughout your information structure.

Things that should be scattered about and associated by location with
~specific topics~ are:

  - l   general link to remember  (located within relevant project and tagged)
  - ze  Email Item to Address     (tagged, not located)
        =FIGURE OUT HOW TO COLLECT USING EMACS EMAILS NEEDING ATTENTION=
  - za  Action Item to Address    (tagged, not located)
  - b   a book to read            (tagged, not located because any project may have suggested books)
  - v   a video to watch          (tagged, not located because any project may have suggested videos)
  - w   website to visit          (tagged, not located because any project may have suggested websites)

Things that should be in one place are:

  - zm ::	Meeting Notes (documented understandings, action items, questions)
    (may be refiled into a relevant project)
    =BE SURE TO TURN ON REFILING HISTORY COLLECTION SO WE CAN SEE WHICH MEETING IT CAME FROM=

  - Things to Study Further (websites, books, videos)
    (may be refiled into a relevant project)
    - r   research to undertake

  - personal major projects
    mathematics
      conceptual tools
        differential calculus
        integral calculus
      laws

***** TODO Blood Pressure Measurement

As part of self-measurement, I periodically take my blood pressure and keep it
in a table to identify long-term trends.

This capture template is a =table-line= or a new line in a table at a specific
place.  It uses the following replaceable parameters.

  - %u           :: inactive date/time stamp
  - %^{High}     :: prompt "High" and insert a value for high pressure
  - %^{Low}      :: prompt "Low" and insert a value for low pressure
  - %^{Pulse}    :: prompt "Pulse" and insert a value for pulse rate
  - %^{Comment}  :: prompt "Comment" and insert a value for comment, if any

org-babel-load-file() doesn't seem to respect the =:tangle no= srcblock header option
  uses: =org-babel-tangle()= to extract elisp and then load using =load-file=.

**** Possible Destinations for Refiling Requests

A list of cons cells, where

- Position 1:
   is a specification of the files to be considered, either a list of
   files, or a symbol whose function or variable value will be used to
   retrieve a file name or a list of file names.

   For example, if you use `org-agenda-files' for that, all agenda files
   will be scanned for targets.  Nil means consider headings in the
   current buffer.

- Position 2:
   is a specification of how to find candidate refile targets, such as:

   - a cons cell (:tag . "TAG")
     to identify refile targets by a tag.  This tag has to be present
     in all target headlines, inheritance will not be considered.

   - a cons cell (:todo . "KEYWORD")
     to identify refile targets by todo keyword.

   - a cons cell (:regexp . "REGEXP")
     with a regular expression matching headlines that are refiling targets.

   - a cons cell (:level . N)
     Any headline of level N is considered a target.  Note that, when
     `org-odd-levels-only' is set, level corresponds to order in hierarchy,
     not to the number of stars.

   - a cons cell (:maxlevel . N)
     Any headline with level <= N is a target.  Note that, when
     `org-odd-levels-only' is set, level corresponds to order in hierarchy,
     not to the number of stars.

When this variable is nil, all top-level headlines in the current buffer are
used, equivalent to the value `((nil . (:level . 1))'.

**** *pushing* URL/title links from Firefox into the Emacs kill-buffer

The actual command that pushes a link into Emacs is:

$ /usr/bin/emacsclient org-protocol:/store-link:/URL/TITLE

and we want to provide a button in Firefox that causes it to issue this
command.  We do this by defining a 'bookmarklet', which is a Firefox bookmark
with the location field containing a bit of JavaScript instead of a URL.

  Name: PushLink
  Location: (as one long line)
    javascript:location.href='org-protocol://store-link://'+
          encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'/'+
          encodeURIComponent(document.title)+'/'+
          encodeURIComponent(window.getSelection())

We also have to teach Firefox which program to run to handle the URL protocol
of 'org-protocol', which in my case is =/usr/bin/emacsclient=.

A protocol is a method that is used to send, receive, and handle information
over a connection.  Common protocols viewed from the browser include http,
https, ftp, and mailto.  In order for you to view information sent over a
specific protocol, it must be registered.  If you enter a URL for an unknown
protocol (foo) in the Location Bar, you will receive a message such as,
Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (foo)
isn't associated with any program or, in Mozilla Suite/SeaMonkey, foo not a
registered protocol.

Once registered, the protocol can then be handled by the program you specify,
such as your browser or a third party viewer.  This means that a hyperlink (
e.g. foo://fred) can use the handler for protocol foo to open the file named
fred.

    Type about:config into the Location Bar (address bar) and press Enter.
    Right-click -> New -> Boolean -> Name: network.protocol-handler.expose.foo -> Value -> false (Replace foo with the protocol you're specifying)
    Next time you click a link of protocol-type foo you will be asked which application to open it with.

In the firefox address box type this simple but weird-looking URL about:config
and open it.  Then right-click on any entry in the long list that comes up.
Right-clicking brings up the menu we will use to create a new entry.  Select
new and of type boolean.  Carefully type in the name of the new preference as

    network.protocol-handler.expose.mms

and then select for its value false.  We are finished with this window, so you
can close it.


network.protocol-handler.external.mms   boolean  true


Apparently they changed the way this works. You need to add a
org-protocol.desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications

  [Desktop Entry]
  Name=org-protocol
  Exec=emacsclient %u
  Type=Application
  Terminal=false
  Categories=System;
  MimeType=x-scheme-handler/org-protocol;

Then run:

  $ update-desktop-database .local/share/applications/

For some reason I cannot get the bookmarklets to work, however. But
opening an org-protocol:/ URL directly works.


network.protocol-handler.app.org-protocol string /usr/bin/emacsclient


For some reason, it is needed create a mime type on ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list 

So I add:
application/x-tivion=tivion.desktop;
application/tivion=tivion.desktop;
x-scheme-handler/tivion=tivion.desktop;



I never had the window asking for which application to launch when clicking on
a `org-protocol://' link...

until I re-did the manipulation with:

--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/org-protocol/command '/usr/bin/emacsclient %s'
--type String
gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/org-protocol/enabled --type Boolean true
--8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---

(described on http://kb.mozillazine.org/Register_protocol#All_Firefox_versions_.28requires_certain_Gnome_libraries_to_be_installed.29)

"Next time you click a link of protocol-type foo you will be asked which
application to open it with." : for me, after the above step (`gconftool-2'),
just entering `org-protocol://' in a new tab was sufficient to ask, this time,
for which application to run. Finally...

Not that intuitive...

(Linux and Mac) If the path or name is incorrect when setting the
network.protocol-handler.app.(protocol) preference , Firefox will display an
error saying "protocol (foo) isn't associated with any program". (bug 312953)


And here's what some snippets of a 'foobar' scheme registration looks like stored in Firefox's mimeTypes.rdf file:

<RDF:li RDF:resource="urn:scheme:foobar"/>
<RDF:Description RDF:about="urn:handler:web:http://www.lookout.net/foobar=%s"
                 NC:prettyName="The foobar scheme"
                 NC:uriTemplate="http://www.lookout.net/foobar=%s" />
<RDF:Description RDF:about="urn:scheme:foobar"
                 NC:value="foobar">
<NC:handlerProp RDF:resource="urn:scheme:handler:foobar"/>
<RDF:Description RDF:about="urn:scheme:handler:foobar"
                 NC:alwaysAsk="true">

**** org-protocol (intercept calls from emacsclient to trigger custom actions)

Make a bookmarklet button for:

    javascript:location.href='org-protocol://sub-protocol://'+
          encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'/'+
          encodeURIComponent(document.title)+'/'+
          encodeURIComponent(window.getSelection())

store-link uses only the URL and page title

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ emacsclient org-protocol:/store-link:/URL/TITLE
#+END_SRC

Pushes the given URL/title onto the kill-ring for yanking (C-y).

org-protocol-store-link (links and bookmarks)

org-protocol-capture (note taking and citations)

  emacsclient org-protocol:/capture:/URL/TITLE/BODY

will pop up an *Capture* buffer and fill the template with the data submitted.

javascript:location.href='org-protocol://capture://'+
      encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'/'+
      encodeURIComponent(document.title)+'/'+
      encodeURIComponent(window.getSelection())

Controlling _which_ capture template will be used:

You don't need to set up a capture template to use org-protocol-capture, since
Org-mode provides a default template for those cases.  Newer versions provide
an interactive interface for choosing a template.  You may provide a template
to be used by customizing the variable org-capture-default-template.  The
problem with this solution would be, that only one template can be used with
the function.

Luckily, org-protocol-capture understands a slightly extended syntax to choose
between several templates: If the first field of the data submitted is exactly
one character in length, this character will be used to select the template.

$ emacsclient org-protocol:/capture:/x/URL/TITLE/BODY

javascript:location.href='org-protocol://capture://x/'+
      encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'/'+
      encodeURIComponent(document.title)+'/'+
      encodeURIComponent(window.getSelection())

Edit published content: org-protocol-open-source

This one was designed to help with opening sources for editing when browsing
in the first place. org-protocol-open-source uses the custom variable
org-protocol-project-alist to map URLs to (local) filenames.

These bookmarklets enable your Firefox to talk to emacsclient via a new
protocol (org-protocol://); emacsclient then parses the request and tells
Emacs to capture or store stuff at the relevant places in your Org files.

****** Segment My Agenda Views into Topics Using Super-Agenda

The primary use of the github:[[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda][org-super-agenda]] package is to post-process the
list of items, usually for the daily/weekly agenda, made by the
~org-agenda-list~ command, but it also works for other agenda views, like
~org-tags-view~, ~org-todo-list~, ~org-search-view~, etc.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-super-agenda
    :load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/org-super-agenda/"  ;; use my Git checkout

****** Agenda: Find Incorrect INBOX Entries with a SCHEDULED Keyword

There seems to be a bug in the Orgzly Android app, in that each time a new
entry is created, it adds a SCHEDULED date of the day it was created.  This
messes up my agenda views, making me think that every such entry has been
scheduled for me to work on it.

#+NAME: define-agenda-1-FindScheduledInboxEntries
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports code :tangle no
  ("1" "Find Mis-Scheduled Inbox entries" agenda  ;; key[1] desc[2] type[3]

      (org-agenda-remove-tags t)
      (org-agenda-span 2)         ;; show me 2-days at a time
      (org-agenda-files '("~/Dropbox/Documents/Inbox.org"))

****** Agenda: Find Entries Tagged :UNFILED: So I Can Move Them Where They Belong

This agenda collects all headlines tagged :UNFILED: regardless of whether they
are a TODO or non-TODO and presents it as a set of lists broken into the
follow kinds:

 - Collected Links (headlines with :LINK: tag)
 - Collected Tasks (headlines with TODO)
 - Collected Notes (headlines without either of the above)

Note the use of the +ALLTAGS query expression, which means to include both
direct *and* inherited tags.  This allows me to collect unfiled entries under
a headline with a :UNFILED: tag and not have to tediously place such a tag on
each and every headline.  This lets me more easily move entries around.

#+CAPTION: Example of My Tagging Hierarchy
#+BEGIN_SRC org
  * Finance Unclassified Entries        :UNFILED:
    * http://CoolLink                   :LINK:
  * Personal Unclassified Entries       :UNFILED:
    * TODO Oh yeah do this
  * Business Unclassified Entries       :UNFILED:
#+END_SRC

I also use a custom :NOSEARCH: tag to skip including some :UNFILED: entries in
this agenda view.

I defined a [[file:~/Dropbox/Documents/index.org::*Organize%20All%20:UNFILED:%20Entries%20Each%20Month][recurring habit to periodically review]] this agenda view and move
entries to where they belong.

#+NAME: define-agenda-3-FindUnfiledEntries
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports code :tangle no
  ("3" "Find :UNFILED: entries" tags  ;; key[1] desc[2] type[3]
    "+ALLTAGS={UNFILED}-NOSEARCH=1"  ;; entry match-expression[4]
    ( ;; [5] list of settings local to this custom agenda view
      (org-agenda-overriding-header "Items Needing Proper Filing")
      (org-super-agenda-groups agendagroups/items-needing-filing)

      (org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(category-up priority-down alpha-up))
      (org-agenda-remove-tags t)
;;      (org-super-agenda-unmatched-name "Other Items")
;;      (org-agenda-files '("~/Dropbox/Documents/index.org"))
    )
    ("/tmp/NeedsRefiling.pdf")  ;; file(s)-to-export[6]
  )
#+END_SRC

Also note my use above of the Org-SuperAgenda Emacs module to empower my
presentation of the collected headlines.  The above reference uses the
following elisp variable to segregate the headlines into sections.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq agendagroups/items-needing-filing
    '(
       (:name "Collected Links"
         :tag "LINK"

         :todo t
       )

       (:name "Collected Notes"
         :anything t  ;; place remaining entries under this heading

     )
  )
#+END_SRC

****** Agenda: Find TODOs Tagged as Recurring Tasks

This agenda collects all TODO headlines that are either scheduled to start or
have a deadline to fnish.

#+NAME: define-agenda-R-FindRecurringTasks
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports code :tangle no
  ("R" "Recurring/Habits" todo  ;; key[1] desc[2] type[3]

;;;      (org-super-agenda-unmatched-name "Other Items")
    )
    ("/tmp/MyHabits.pdf")  ;; file(s)-to-export[6]
  )
#+END_SRC

Also note my use above of the Org-SuperAgenda Emacs module to empower my
presentation of the collected headlines.  The above reference uses the
following elisp variable to further filter the headlines and then segregate
the headlines into short-term and long-term variants of topic-specific
sections:

 - Short-Term Habitual Tasks: Finance
 - Short-Term Habitual Tasks: Health
 - Short-Term Habitual Tasks: Other Items

 - Long-Term Recurring Tasks: Finance
 - Long-Term Recurring Tasks: Health
 - Long-Term Recurring Tasks: Tech
 - Long-Term Recurring Tasks: Other items

Short-term is defined as those headlines declared as Org-Mode 'habits', with
long-team meaning it recurs but isn't strictly an Org-Mode 'habit'.  See [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html][The
Org Manual: Tracking your habits]] for an explanation of the difference.

Selecting my choice of mail composition package.

Choices are =mail-mode=, PostMode and MessageMode.

=mail-mode= is defined in =sendmail.el= which is part of Emacs.

[[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MessageMode][EmacsWiki: Message Mode]]

Message mode is an alternative to mail mode for composing and sending messages
inside emacs. This is part of the standard emacs distribution, and is the
preferred mode used by gnus for composing and sending messages. It can be used
independently from gnus however, and has its own manual.

This manual can be browsed online at [1] or directly from inside emacs (C-h i
m message RET).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

  (setq message-default-mail-headers "Cc: \nBcc: \n")

  ;; with Emacs 23.1, you have to set this explicitly (in MS Windows)
  ;; otherwise it tries to send through OS associated mail client
  (setq message-send-mail-function 'message-send-mail-with-sendmail)
#+END_SRC

- C-c C-c :: send the message and exit the message buffer
- C-c C-a :: add an attachment
- C-c C-k :: cancel the message
- C-c C-d :: postpone the message
- C-c C-s :: send the message but don't exit the message buffer
- C-c C-b :: go to the start of the message
- C-c C-z :: kill text from point until end of buffer

Warning (mail): The default mail mode is now Message mode.
You have the following Mail mode variables customized:

- mail-setup-hook  value is (turn-on-mime-edit)
- mail-send-hook   value is (mime-edit-maybe-translate)

Generally, the :inbox: tag is the indicator of whether the email has been
handled.  That tag is removed when the email is archived or otherwise handled.
The :unread: tag is less reliable as my mobile apps for reading email easily
clear the :unread:tag and it is not simple to add it back each time this
happens.

The following causes inline images to respect an image size attribute, if
present, else use the image's actual size.  The image size attribute looks
like:

  #+CAPTION: Architecture Stack for Virtual Machines
  #+NAME:   fig:Hierarchy-VMs
  #+ATTR_HTML: :width 600px
  [[some path]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

** IMenu

Imenu

Imenu is a useful and extensible tool in Emacs that lets you jump to key areas
of your buffer, most usually functions definitions in source
code. Unfortunately, the imenu is marred somewhat by no default key binding
(M-x imenu to invoke) making it less known than it should be; another negative
is that it uses the standard completion mechanism which is terrible for
quickly navigating by "feel".

I use a super-charged ido version of imenu and bind it to the M-i key:

(global-set-key (kbd "M-i") 'ido-goto-symbol)

(rectangular select)

(folding Python structures)
(running Python in emacs)


(figure out how to open a file with a partially specified filename)

(find way to group keydefs and show them)

(M-e in isearch-edit-string lets you edit the search text)

** TODO open emacsclient in a new frame, close frame when done, and kill any buffers I used

To open the files designated by emacsclient in their _own frame_, you can use
the following hook as a Server Switch Hook which can be setup in
customize-group <RET> Server <RET>, or in your InitFile, as such:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;;(add-hook 'server-switch-hook
  ;;   (lambda nil
  ;;      (let ((server-buf (current-buffer)))
  ;;      (bury-buffer)
  ;;      (switch-to-buffer-other-frame server-buf))))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;;(add-hook 'server-switch-hook
  ;;          (lambda ()
  ;;            (unless (find-if (lambda (f)
  ;;                         (let ((p (frame-parameters f)))
  ;;                           (assq 'window-system p)))
  ;;                       (frame-list))
  ;;        (make-frame-on-display (getenv "DISPLAY")))))

  ;;(add-hook 'server-visit-hook 'make-frame)
#+END_SRC

You might also want to close the frame when you're done with it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; (add-hook 'server-done-hook 'delete-frame)
#+END_SRC

I also like emacs to cleanup stuff when I finish the emacsclient, so I add
another hook to kill the buffer when finished. This also takes care of weird
buffer switching behaviors when closing client buffers.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; (add-hook 'server-done-hook (lambda nil (kill-buffer nil)))
#+END_SRC

You can also use 'server-kill-new-buffers' instead of calling 'kill-buffer' in
your 'server-done-hook', e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;  (custom-set-variables '(server-kill-new-buffers t))
;;  (add-hook 'server-done-hook (lambda () (delete-frame)))
#+END_SRC

* Providing a Function to Calculate Easter for Org-Mode Events

The calculation for Easter is complex, but the following Elisp code will
calculate it.  The code come from:

   http://github.com/soren/elisp/blob/master/da-kalender.el

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun da-easter (year)
    "Calculate the date for Easter Sunday in YEAR. Returns the date in the
  Gregorian calendar, ie (MM DD YY) format."
    (let* ((century (1+ (/ year 100)))
           (shifted-epact (% (+ 14 (* 11 (% year 19))
                                (- (/ (* 3 century) 4))
                                (/ (+ 5 (* 8 century)) 25)
                                (* 30 century))
                             30))
           (adjusted-epact (if (or (= shifted-epact 0)
                                   (and (= shifted-epact 1)
                                        (< 10 (% year 19))))
                               (1+ shifted-epact)
                             shifted-epact))
           (paschal-moon (- (calendar-absolute-from-gregorian
                             (list 4 19 year))
                            adjusted-epact)))
      (calendar-dayname-on-or-before 0 (+ paschal-moon 7))))

  (defun da-easter-gregorian (year)
    (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute (da-easter year)))

  (defun calendar-days-from-easter ()
    "When used in a diary sexp, this function will calculate how many days
  are between the current date (DATE) and Easter Sunday."
    (- (calendar-absolute-from-gregorian date)
       (da-easter (calendar-extract-year date))))
#+END_SRC

Now we can schedule the public holidays associated with Easter as recurring
events.  Good Friday is 2 days before "Easter", Easter Monday is one day
after.

*** Good Friday
<%%(= -2 (calendar-days-from-easter))>

*** Easter Sunday
<%%(= 0 (calendar-days-from-easter))>

*** Easter Monday
<%%(= 1 (calendar-days-from-easter))>
